We'll be able to list out all of the tasks in the todo list, create new ones, and complete them
     1)A Client side application for todo list that will talk directly to the blockchain
     2)Used Ethereum Blockchain (Ganache), which we can access by connecting our client side application to a single Ethereum node. Smart Contracts in Solidity powers the todo list.
     3)Connects blockchain network with our personal account using Ethereum Wallet(Metamask) inorder to interact with the todo list application 
â€“	Tools & technologies used: Blockchain technology, Truffle Framework, Solidity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
